# Utility scripts

This folder contains utility scripts for IRC4Orca:
* __run-Orca-4.0.1__ - Example run script for Orca 4.0.1, which takes the input file as argument and redirects Orca's output to a file terminated with the .out extension. 
* __irc-concatenate.py__ - Takes three trajectory files as arguments: the IRC in the forward direction, the IRC in the reverse direction, and a name for the output file. It automatically inverts the trajectory in the second file and outputs a merged IRC trajectory, from products to reactants.
